  /*
  REVIEW NOTES:

  This contract represents an initial working implementation for a representation of a single RMRK base.

  In its current implementation, the single base struct is overloaded to handle both fixed and slot-style
  assets. This implementation is simple but inefficient, as each stores a complete string representation.
  of each asset. Future implementations may want to include a mapping of common prefixes / suffixes and
  getters that recompose these assets on the fly.

  IntakeStruct currently requires the user to pass an id of type bytes8 as an identifier. Other options
  include computing the id on-chain as a hash of attributes of the struct, or a simple incrementer. Passing
  an ID or an incrementer will likely be the cheapest in terms of gas cost.

  In its current implementation, all base asset entries MUST be passed via an array during contract construction.
  This is the only way to ensure contract immutability after deployment, though due to the gas costs of RMRK
  base assets it is hightly recommended that developers are offered a commit > freeze pattern, by which developers
  are allowed multiple commits until a 'freeze' function is called, after which the base contract is no
  longer mutable.
