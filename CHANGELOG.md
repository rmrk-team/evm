## [2.0.0] - 2023-08-01

This Release has significant breaking changes in all ready-to-use implementations. The inheritance flow was highly simplified, by merging all extra utilities, which a marketplace would typically expect, into a single abstract contract: `RMRKImplementationBase`. This contract replaces `RMRKCollectionMetadata`, `RMRKMintingUtils` contracts and `name` and `symbol` of all core implementations.

The contract includes royalties, a method to update the royalties recipient, internal utils to keep track of next token and asset IDs, and the following getters that marketplaces commonly expect:

- `totalSupply`
- `maxSupply`
- `name`
- `symbol`
- `collectionMetadata`

Implementations no longer share the same constructor data; they only accept the necessary data. This reduces the size of the contracts allowing for more custom logic within your smart contract.

Core implementations updates include breaking changes as well; names and symbols were removed from them to keep them fully non-opinionated.

### Added

- Added Soulbound implementation versions for all ready-to-use implementations.
- Added `CollectionUtils` with methods to get several data points with a single call. This is a utility contract that only needs to be deployed once per chain, just like `RenderUtils`. `getPaginatedMintedIds` was moved from render utils to this contract.
- Added new Render Utils methods: `getTotalDescendants`, `hasMoreThanOneLevelOfNesting`
- Added `TokenPropertiesRepository`.
- Added `TokenHolder` extension.
- Added new networks to Hardhat config: Sepolia, Polygon Mumbai, Polygon, and Mainnet. Removed GÃ¶rli.
- Started keeping a Changelog.

### Changed

- Recreated all ready-to-use implementations for premint and lazy minting with native tokens or custom ERC20 tokens.
- Reduced size of `MinifiedEquippable` contract.
- Premint versions now receive `tokenURI` on mint. Lazy mint versions use the base URL passed to a constructor and append `tokenId` to compose the `tokenURI`.
- Removed Split Equippable implementations, which kept `MultiAsset` and `Equippable` legos in a different contract to `Nestable`.
- Merged all the extras needed for a full implementation into a single contract: `RMRKImplementationBase`.
- Splits `tokenURI` extension into two versions, one using ID per token (`RMRKTokenURIPerToken`) and one using base URI, appending tokenId, (`RMRKTokenURIEnumerated`).
- Removes several unneeded mocks.
- Rellocates all errors into `RMRKErrors` lib.
- Adds `IERC721Metadata` interface support to implementations.
- Emotes extension was removed in favor of the shared repository.
- All contracts now use solidity version 0.8.21.
- Upgrades dependencies.
- Increases Istanbul code coverage:

### Fixed

- Fixes `Transfer` event, which was sometimes sending root owner instead of the direct owner.
- Fixes reducing the owner's balance before the `_beforeTransfer` hooks in some contracts.
- Fixes emotes repository to support every possible emoji and relocate it from the extensions folder.
