Interface smart contract of the RMRK equippable module.



## Methods

### acceptAsset

```solidity
function acceptAsset(uint256 tokenId, uint256 index, uint64 assetId) external nonpayable
```

Accepts an asset at from the pending array of given token.

*Migrates the asset from the token&#39;s pending asset array to the token&#39;s active asset array.Active assets cannot be removed by anyone, but can be replaced by a new asset.Requirements:  - The caller must own the token or be approved to manage the token&#39;s assets  - `tokenId` must exist.  - `index` must be in range of the length of the pending asset array.Emits an {AssetAccepted} event.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| tokenId | uint256 | ID of the token for which to accept the pending asset |
| index | uint256 | Index of the asset in the pending array to accept |
| assetId | uint64 | ID of the asset expected to be in the index |

### approveForAssets

```solidity
function approveForAssets(address to, uint256 tokenId) external nonpayable
```

Used to grant permission to the user to manage token&#39;s assets.

*This differs from transfer approvals, as approvals are not cleared when the approved party accepts or  rejects an asset, or sets asset priorities. This approval is cleared on token transfer.Only a single account can be approved at a time, so approving the `0x0` address clears previous approvals.Requirements:  - The caller must own the token or be an approved operator.  - `tokenId` must exist.Emits an {ApprovalForAssets} event.*

|---|---|---|
| to | address | Address of the account to grant the approval to |
| tokenId | uint256 | ID of the token for which the approval to manage the assets is granted |
