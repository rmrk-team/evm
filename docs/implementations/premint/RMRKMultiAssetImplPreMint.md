## Methods

### VERSION

```solidity
function VERSION() external view returns (string)
```

Version of the @rmrk-team/evm-contracts package




#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |

### acceptAsset

```solidity
function acceptAsset(uint256 tokenId, uint256 index, uint64 assetId) external nonpayable
```

Accepts an asset at from the pending array of given token.

*Migrates the asset from the token&#39;s pending asset array to the token&#39;s active asset array.Active assets cannot be removed by anyone, but can be replaced by a new asset.Requirements:  - The caller must own the token or be approved to manage the token&#39;s assets  - `tokenId` must exist.  - `index` must be in range of the length of the pending asset array.Emits an {AssetAccepted} event.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| tokenId | uint256 | ID of the token for which to accept the pending asset |
| index | uint256 | Index of the asset in the pending array to accept |
| assetId | uint64 | ID of the asset expected to be in the index |

### addAssetEntry

```solidity
function addAssetEntry(string metadataURI) external nonpayable returns (uint256)
```

Used to add a asset entry.

*The ID of the asset is automatically assigned to be the next available asset ID.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| metadataURI | string | Metadata URI of the asset |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | uint256 | ID of the newly added asset |

### addAssetToToken

```solidity
function addAssetToToken(uint256 tokenId, uint64 assetId, uint64 replacesAssetWithId) external nonpayable
```

Used to add an asset to a token.

*If the given asset is already added to the token, the execution will be reverted.If the asset ID is invalid, the execution will be reverted.If the token already has the maximum amount of pending assets (128), the execution will be  reverted.If the asset is being added by the current root owner of the token, the asset will be automatically  accepted.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| tokenId | uint256 | ID of the token to add the asset to |
| assetId | uint64 | ID of the asset to add to the token |

### approve

```solidity

```

Used to grant a one-time approval to manage one&#39;s token.

*Gives permission to `to` to transfer `tokenId` token to another account.The approval is cleared when the token is transferred.Only a single account can be approved at a time, so approving the zero address clears previous approvals.Requirements: - The caller must own the token or be an approved operator. - `tokenId` must exist.Emits an {Approval} event.*

#### Parameters

|---|---|---|
| to | address | Address receiving the approval |
