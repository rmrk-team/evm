error RMRKMintZero()
```

Attempting to mint zero tokens




### RMRKNestableTooDeep

```solidity
error RMRKNestableTooDeep()

Attempting to nest a child over the nestable limit (current limit is 100 levels of nesting)




### RMRKNestableTransferToDescendant

```solidity
error RMRKNestableTransferToDescendant()
```

Attempting to nest the token to own descendant, which would create a loop and leave the looped tokens in limbo




### RMRKNestableTransferToNonRMRKNestableImplementer

```solidity
error RMRKNestableTransferToNonRMRKNestableImplementer()
